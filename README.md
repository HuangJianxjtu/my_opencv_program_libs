# Opencv Learning

It's my opencv demo programs and notes. You can use those programs to test whether opencv is well installed on your Ubuntu computer.

## Prerequisite of the installation of openCV

`sudo apt-get install libopencv-* libqt4-dev libv4l-dev v4l2ucp v4l-utils`

after that, if on ubuntu16.04, then run `sudo ldconfig`
## How to check if OpenCV is installed on your computer?

$ pkg-config --modversion opencv

if it's installed, it will return the version of opencv, e.g. 3.2.0
