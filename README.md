# Opencv Learning

It's my opencv demo programs and notes. You can use those programs to test whether opencv is well installed on your Ubuntu computer.

## How to check if OpenCV is installed on your computer?

$ pkg-config --modversion opencv

if it's installed, it will return the version of opencv, e.g. 3.2.0
